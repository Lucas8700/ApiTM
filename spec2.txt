For the streamlit site: A Title: “TOTD Author ranking”
A display showing the ranking of players with the most author medals. 
The display shows ranking + player name + number of author medals + number of missing author medals compared to the total number of maps

We want the display to be by pages of 50 players, and only the top 10000 players possibly shown on the site

Ability to click on a player name. 
Once the player is clicked, display all maps in chronological order from most recent to oldest
Display shows the release date of the map + map name + map author + the number of people who have the author medal + author time + 
author medal logo if the player has the medal on this map + time of the player. Gaps between each month for easy differentiation
We want the ability to sort by increasing/decreasing number of people who have the author medal


We want a search bar that allows to search by player names
